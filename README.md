# **ü§î EXAMPLES docker-compose**

üê≥ This repository contains a collection of docker-compose YAML files for various applications and services. Each docker-compose file is designed to simplify the deployment and management of the corresponding application using Docker containers.
## Getting Started
  üöÄ To get started with any of the applications or services included in this repository, make sure you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, please refer to the official documentation:
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
## Usage
Each application or service has its own directory within this repository, containing a docker-compose.yml file and any associated configuration files. To deploy an application, simply navigate to its directory and run the following command:

  `docker-compose up -d`

üéâ This will start the necessary containers in the background. You can then access the application using the appropriate URL or port, as specified in the documentation of each application.
